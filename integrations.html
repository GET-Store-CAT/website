        <h1>When your web store isn't up to date, you’re losing money</h1>
        <span>Your web store may be the core of your E-Commerce offering, but it’s only part of your operation. StoreCat integrates with your e-commerce platform (like Shopify) and updates your site automatically, so you can focus on helping customers and growing your business. Keep customers happy and your wallet full. <br><br>When your suppliers update their prices, StoreCat’s Web Store integration converts each one to your desired product price, and then automatically updates your Web Store.

        <span>StoreCat’s team of engineers is here to help you automate without your own technical team. StoreCat connects to each of your suppliers and automatically pulls new item information from your suppliers whenever it's available. <br>This information includes pricing, new items, and product details. If there’s something else you need, StoreCat will be sure to grab that too.</span>

            Most management systems are not E-Commerce oriented - StoreCat was made for the web. We can help you bridge your sales team to your supply chain, and give you the room you need to store all of your information in one place. 
            <br>
            Keep your product catalogue organized and up-to-date, with all the numbers you need in one place. With automatic updates, your team will always be able to buy at the best price, and easily purchase and manage your inventory.
            <br>
            Connect StoreCat to your current Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) tool (like [popular ERP tool]) and StoreCat will sync all product information across the platform, integrating the necessary information from your webstore and suppliers.
