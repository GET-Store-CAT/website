Use StoreCat to easily import new items from suppliers, and instantly add them to your store. Keep all your images and product data secure in your own private cloud, and only transfer the ones that you want to sell.</span>

        How many employees does it take to manage a web store? Easy. None. Your employees should be talking to your suppliers and finding new sources of unique products. Let them focus on helping you expand your business, and leave the data transfer to the machines.</span>
