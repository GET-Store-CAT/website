# FishBowl ERP Oversight
No matter what scale you operate at, it's important to have up to date information. If your business is already using the FishBowl ERP tool, we can help you automatically connect it to your web store, and make it possible to keep all of your information up to date, all of the time. 

## Inventory Sync
Connect your web store to your inventory system through StoreCat, and even extend the functionality to allow you to see upstream supply availability for dropshipped items, and streamline purchasing and fulfillment.

## Grow Easily
How many employees does it take to manage a web store? Easy. None. Your employees should be talking to your suppliers and finding new sources of unique products. Let them focus on helping you expand your business, and leave the data transfer to the machines. 

## Automate, and Save
Automation not only reduces employee headaches, but can also ensure that your site is as up to date as possible, which can help to minimize writeoff orders and inaccurate supply availability.
